## Introduction

__ward__ is a binary hardening tool that helps protect against code injection attacks for Linux executables. It provides an intuitive UI that enables
users to readily sign and harden Linux apps they've built or installed in a portable manner in userspace. This is to ultimately help mitigate any attempts
to hijack process runtimes by leveraging `LD_PRELOAD`, and any tampering attempts to the actual executable itself.
